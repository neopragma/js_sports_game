JavaScript Sports Game Challenge

Some questions for reflection and/or discussion.

1. Directory structure

Eric's example:

project/
  |
  +-- index.html
  |
  +-- assets/
       |
       +-- css/
       |    |
       |    +-- style.css
       |    
       +-- javascript/
            |
            +-- game.js

My solution:

project/
  |
  +-- index.html
  |
  +-- styles/
  |    |
  |    +-- site.css   (another common name: default.css)
  |
  +-- scripts/
       |
       +-- game.js 



 1.1. Is any particular directory structure required for a web app?

 1.2. Is any particular directory structure a standard convention in the JavaScript developer community?

 1.3. Do different web browsers require or expect us to use any particular directory hierarchy?

 1.4. What advantages do you see in grouping all non-html assets under a single subdirectory?

 1.5. What advantages do you see in a flatter directory structure instead of the single assets subdirectory (like the second example)?

 1.6. Why do you think someone might name the css subdirectory "styles" instead of "css"? 

 1.7. Why do you think someone might name the javascript subdirectory "scripts" instead of "javascript"?

 1.8. Why do you think someone might name the css file "site" or "default" instead of "style"?


2. Linking the stylesheet and the script.

The sample code has this HTML definition:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">

2.1. What is the meaning of "./" at the beginning of the href value? 

2.2. Are there any other ways to code this that would also work? 

2.3. What advantages do you see in coding the href value in one way versus another way?


3. Effect of changing the directory structure

What if we change the directory structure to this:


project/
  |
  +-- pages/
  |    |
  |    +-- index.html
  |
  +-- styles/
  |    |
  |    +-- site.css   (another common name: default.css)
  |
  +-- scripts/
       |
       +-- game.js 

3.1. How would we code the link and script definitions in index.html?
